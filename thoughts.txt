interact button only shown when door to interact with

implement burning/flamer/moving through flames

Blips are only forced to lurk for one turn
Blips cannot move within one square of a space marine
Blips can be revealed outside Entry Areas (List, blitting a purple number?)

implement Broodlord reveal if possible

checkmove needs to pe appended so that it blocks models from passing diagonally between a model and a wall(p.59)

implement GS moving onto the board from entrypoint

placebl needs to be changed so that the broodlord can be placed

the initial placement of blips must be skippable for certain missions

implement visual distinction for Guard/Overwatch/Jam

melee logic on lightningclaws is wonky, error probably by r1 > r4 anf r1 = r5

certain buttons don't appear/disappear

sustained Fire needs to be proced on every gs individually

add shoot button only after check_ranged()
perhaps split shooting up in different gamestates

the entire map can be made individualistic, so that sections can be distinguished easely

implement doors not opening if burning

implement flamer burning one one side of the door

implement Assaultcannon explosion and reload

implement Psyker phase

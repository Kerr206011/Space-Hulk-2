problem with buttons and tiles overlapping during MOUSEBUTTONDOWN check can be avoided with 
a if - else statement with the buttons in the front

model.face can be shown with colored corner/arrow

terminator weapon/loadout can be displayed by classsystem (GW 8th symbols)

interact button only shown when door to interact with

Blips are only forced to lurk for one turn
Blips can be revealed outside Entry Areas (List, blitting a purple number?)

implement Broodlord reveal if possible

checkmove needs to pe appended so that it blocks models from passing diagonally between a model and a wall(p.59) 

placebl needs to be changed so that the broodlord can be placed

the initial placement of blips must be skippable for certain missions

implement visual distinction for Guard/Overwatch/Jam

certain buttons don't appear/disappear

sustained Fire needs to be processed on every gs individually

add shoot button only after check_ranged()

the entire map can be made individualistic, so that sections can be distinguished easely

implement flamer burning one one side of the door

implement Assaultcannon explosion and reload

implement Psyker phase 

fix UI

implement SM reveal

add oos Actions

add overwatch/oos Actions to revealSM
add overwatch to turn

check shoot and freeshoot interactions very thoroughly

add broodlord to sm reveal (1st model)
add oos actions to sm reveal
add entrypointreveal to Sm reveal

reveal is only finished in Sm Action!!!

ideas for Client server:
    clients have run() for gamestates, but they only log and send the clicks and have no internal logic
    server sends updates for the map, client displays it

problem with buttons and tiles overlapping during MOUSEBUTTONDOWN check can be avoided with 
a if - else statement with the buttons in the front

model.face can be shown with colored corner/arrow

terminator weapon/loadout can be displayed by classsystem (GW 8th symbols)

interact button only shown when door to interact with (now not always shown)

Blips can be revealed outside Entry Areas (List, blitting a purple number?)

implement Broodlord reveal on entrypoint

checkmove needs to pe appended so that it blocks models from passing diagonally between a model and a wall(p.59) 

the initial placement of blips must be skippable for certain missions

implement visual distinction for Guard/Overwatch/Jam

certain buttons don't appear/disappear

sustained Fire needs to be processed on every gs individually
    -> change susf to a model and compare

add shoot button only after check_ranged()

the entire map can be made individualistic, so that sections can be distinguished easely

implement flamer burning one one side of the door(perhaps pathfinding)

implement Assaultcannon explosion and reload

implement Psyker phase 

fix UI
    use shade method and local button icons (circle menu)

add oos Actions

add overwatch/oos Actions to revealSM

check shoot and freeshoot interactions very thoroughly

add broodlord to sm reveal (1st model)
add entrypointreveal to Sm reveal

add comments to methods

integrate oos and smplace

should the turning be so that a full turn isn't possible? (for reveal purposes)

oos actions:
add cost
    melee, end

reload(add to normal activation)

add ac explosion

add animations for all the actions (including the dice)
add highlight for selected/clicked

go through the code and add the blips to the plip-RESERVE whenever they are destroyed

change movement, so that the model in question can be moved x tiles (perhaps a snapping rect to show where it would go and how much it would cost)

add use for the amount button in BLStart and BLplace

after rooling the cp again, the button for reroll needs to disappear

having a door breaks the actionbar (exit is unclickable)

loading breaks lurking blips and SM's

ideas for Client server:
    clients have run() for gamestates, but they only log and send the clicks and have no internal logic
    server sends updates for the map, client displays it

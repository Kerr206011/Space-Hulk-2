problem with buttons and tiles overlapping during MOUSEBUTTONDOWN check can be avoided with 
a if - else statement with the buttons in the front

model.face can be shown with colored corner/arrow

terminator weapon/loadout can be displayed by classsystem (GW 8th symbols)

Blips can be revealed outside Entry Areas (List, blitting a purple number?)

implement Broodlord reveal on entrypoint

the initial placement of blips must be skippable for certain missions

implement visual distinction for Guard/Overwatch/Jam

sustained Fire needs to be processed on every gs individually

the entire map can be made individualistic, so that sections can be distinguished easely

implement flamer burning one one side of the door(perhaps pathfinding)

implement Assaultcannon explosion and reload

implement Psyker phase 

fix UI

add oos Actions

add comments to methods

integrate oos and smplace

reload(add to normal activation)

add ac explosion

add animations for all the actions (including the dice)
add highlight for selected/clicked

change movement, so that the model in question can be moved x tiles (perhaps a snapping rect to show where it would go and how much it would cost)

ideas for Client server:
    clients have run() for gamestates, but they only log and send the clicks and have no internal logic
    server sends updates for the map, client displays it

Version: 0.0.5

level needs to be changable in lobby
server needs to shut down if no player is connected
from_data in Sm and Gs needs to automatically select the Pictures based on rank/weapon or Broodlord status
need to make server send more robust, insert exeption handeling
add join menu
add debug gamestate to test ingame interactions or make it a toggelable option with a variable
add scale to UI Objects
scaling slider in config needs work
give the Slider a method to put it at a certain position
add options with the Sprite classes to adjust the parameters of the Tiles (like burning etc.)
add a main Method to the server so it can be shutdown correctly instead of creashing whenever someone disconnects
    added disconnect method to client, last client to  disconnect still gets error
add a variable to the saved SM models so that they can be attributed to a Spawnarea
    implement a grouping of squads in json, so they be deployed in groups
implement logger 
    check all print statements
change entrypoint class so that it can utilise saved lists to fill its blips/genstealer lists
finish the Server main method, so that it is clearer what the server is doing an when(
    should the server ustilise only the main method, with the threads only passing the infos from their
    clients along, or should the main method only be for directing the flow of the game?
)
change the Pictures in the serverside Tile Objects to represents their namesake

deploysm not placed models need to regroup after one has been placed

Serverside and Clientside setup needs to be changed, so that multiple squads of SM may be deployed to different
areas 

Todo: Implement GS deploy Gamestate, preferably so that it can be utilised both during setup and gameplay
